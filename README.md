This is a simple example of creating and consuming a distributable
Python package.
While I find the Python language to be intuitive and useful
So this is to just be a simple example of how to create and consume a package
 as a reference for myself.

 'python setup.py sdist'

 'pip install git+https://github.com/james-Leslie/example-python-packages.git'
